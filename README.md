## DeepLearningArchitectures
Implementations of various deep learning architectures + extra theoretical information

### [CNNS](cnn.py)
**Feature Extraction Local connectivity:**
1. Apply a feature extraction filter == convolution layer.
2. Add bias to the filter function.
3. Activate with a non-linear function e.g ReLU for thresholding.
4. Pooling: dimesnionality reduction of generated feature maps from 1&2 above. Still maintains spatial invariance.

**Classification:**
1. Apply a fully connected layer that uses the high-level features from 1-2-3 to perform classification.

Other potential applications; to achieve, you only modify the fully-connected layer bit == step1 under classification.
- Segmentation.
- Object Detection.
- Regression.
- Probabilistic Control.
- Autonomous navigation.
